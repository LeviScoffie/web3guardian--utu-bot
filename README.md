## Description
The Web3Guardian Telegram bot is a powerful and user-friendly bot that leverages **UTU** protocol's trust engine to enhance trustworthiness in digital interactions on the internet.

The bot allows users to securely give and receive feedback on Decentralized Applications (dApps) and their users on Telegram hence strengthening their reputation.

## Problem Statement
The online space has been murred with malicious actors and spam, specifically on telegram. By using our UTU Web3Guardian bot, you will be able to idenfity bad actors and therefore protect yourself from fraudulent activities such as:

- **View Reputation:** Check out a user's reputation (feedback and rating) given by other users and entities that interacted with the bot before.

- **User Verification:** Ascertain that user owns a telegram account.

- **Decentralized Storage:** Create,store, and manage reviews and feedback in UTU's backend using the provided API endpoints for user entities and their relationships.
